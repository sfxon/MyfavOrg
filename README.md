## Description

Extends your Shopware 6 store with functionality for companies.

* **Create Companies**.
* Customer-Accounts can now be assigned to companies. They can then be seen and managed as **Employees**.
* Employees can have different **Access Rights**. The plugin comes with an integrated **ACL** (Access Control List). So you can define, which employees of your company can take which actions in the shop.
* Manage **Budgets** for your employees.
* Organize your employees in teams for **Order Approval**. Order approval allows orders to be placed on hold until they are approved after review.
