# Frequently Asked Questions

## Is it possible to define individual rights for one customer account?

Yes and no. ACL Access Rights can only be defined by ACL Roles.

If you want one specific customer to have individual Access Rights, just define a custom ACL Role.
You might name it like the Customer Accounts First- and Last-Name, for example.
If you have this requirement quite often, please take some time and think about the Access Right Definitions you make.
The ACL Access Rights System is not that complex, that you have to define a huge amount of ACL Roles.
Usually you can define a couple of ACL Roles, which already should fit your needs for the most of your Company Customer Accounts.
